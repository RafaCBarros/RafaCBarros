- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RafaelaBarros, currently getting my Bachelor Degree in Computer Science.
- I will play almost any medieval fantasy TTRPG, have an urge to draw at the weirdest times and probably space out at the weirdest moments/for the most mundane reason.
- I am trying to learn how to use GitHub and other platforms to make sure that people get to know what I have learned instead of me just saying it, as a means to provide proof, in a sense.
- There is still much for me to learn, but I put the effort into learning. I have learned JavaScript, C, HTML and CSS and concepts not tied to languages, such as Object Oriented Programming and plain logic. Now I wish only to execute it.
- You can reach me via email 'rafaelaluiza.cbarros@gmail.com', if you are so inclined.
